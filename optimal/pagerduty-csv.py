    A sample script to programatically access the PD alerts csv-page behind the login, via a single-session.
    CLI USAGE: './get_alerts_csv.py SINCE-TIMESTAMP UNTIL-TIMESTAMP'
    Currently, timestamps should be in the format '2013-09-10T00:00:00Z'.
    Also, currently, subdomain, email, and password are all hard-coded, but no reason they can't be passed in as well, if need be.
